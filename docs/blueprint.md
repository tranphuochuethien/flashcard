- Primary color: Soft lavender (#E6E6FA), evoking a sense of calm and focus.
- Background color: Light gray (#F5F5F5) for a clean and unobtrusive learning environment.
- Accent color: Dusty rose (#D8BFD8) to highlight key terms and interactive elements, for contrast without distraction.
- Body and headline font: 'PT Sans', a humanist sans-serif with a modern, clear look that’s easy to read, especially in long sessions.
- Simple, clear icons for navigation and actions (e.g., flip, next, shuffle).
- Clean, minimal layout with ample white space to reduce visual clutter. Flashcards should be the focal point.
- Subtle animations for card flipping and transitions to provide visual feedback without being distracting.
